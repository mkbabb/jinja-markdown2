<h1>A section of Canto IV</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>To say to me began my gracious Master: "Him with that falchion in his hand behold, Who
  comes before the three, even as their lord.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>That one is Homer, Poet sovereign; He who comes next is Horace, the satirist; The
  third is Ovid, and the last is Lucan.</p>
</blockquote>
